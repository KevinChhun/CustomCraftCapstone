        <h2>1. Project Title & Introduction</h2>
        
        <p><strong>CustomCraft</strong> is an application made for Android that allows users to search for artists and be able to commission them for custom made items. Artists can use this app to be commissioned and earn money. This app provides a platform for customers to connect with artists or artisans for the purpose of purchasing custom commissioned arts and crafts. .</p>
        <p>Many online marketplaces focus on selling pre-made items, which leaves little room for customers who want something unique or personalized. People sometimes want a product in a specific style, but it doesn't exist on the marketplace. Current systems for commissioning work are often done through social media or informal messaging, which could be disorganized and unreliable for the artist and customer.</p>

    <p>CustomCraft addresses this issue by providing an application where users can request custom-made items and artists can earn some income from commissions. The goal of this project is to be able to give a way of
customers being able to gain an item they've longed for, and for artists to get paid for their hard work in the process. By creating a user-friendly platform, CustomCraft helps customers turn their ideas into reality
while giving artists a reliable way to showcase their skills and earn income.</p>

        <h2>2. Background & Motivation</h2>
        <p><strong>CustomCraft</strong> is important to me and probably other people because I've experienced this problem before. I look up something on sites like Etsy or Amazon, but the item I want either doesn't exist, or does not fit a style I like. By developing this app, I hope that I can fix this ongoing issue of specialized items not existing on the marketplace. I've seen how talented some artists are and want to give them a platform that feels comfortable to be commissioned and earn some hard-earned money for their work.</p>

        <h2>3. Methodology / Approach</h2>
        <p>User interviews → low-fi prototypes → iterative UI built in Jetpack Compose → backend using Firebase (Firestore for data, Storage for images, Cloud Functions for server-side logic).</p>
      </section>

      <section id="results" class="card section">
        <h2>4. Results & Findings</h2>
        <p>The prototype supports: artist profiles, commission requests with references, deadline tracking, in-app messaging, image uploads, and mock payment flow.</p>
