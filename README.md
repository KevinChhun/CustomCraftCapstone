            <h2>1. Project Title & Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>CustomCraft</strong> is a mobile app designed to streamline the process of commissioning custom, handmade products from independent artists. While existing platforms focus on shopping for pre-made items, very few support the collaborative, back-and-forth communication required for custom creations.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project explores how a digital platform can improve communication, organization, and accessibility in artistic commissioning. Our goal is to build an end-to-end system—from user profiles to artist selection, commission requests, progress updates, and payments—implemented using Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and Firebase.
            </p>

        <section id="motivation">
            <h2>2. Background & Motivation</h2>
            <p>
                Many people commission handmade items through social media, where conversations easily become disorganized or lost. Artists often lack tools to manage client requests, track progress, store references, and maintain secure payments. CustomCraft aims to address these problems through a structured, mobile-first interface.
            </p>

        <section id="approach">
            <h2>3. Methodology / Approach</h2>
            <p>
                Our approach includes user research, iterative UI prototyping, and full-stack development. The mobile client is built using Kotlin & Jetpack Compose, while Firebase provides authentication, cloud storage, Firestore database, and serverless functions for backend logic.

        <section id="results">
            <h2>4. Results & Findings</h2>
            <p>
                The working prototype allows users to browse artist profiles, create commission requests, exchange messages, upload reference images, and track project progress in-app.

        <section id="future">
            <h2>5. Discussion & Future Work</h2>
            <p>
                Future improvements include adding integrated payments, ratings, chat enhancements, marketplace discovery features, and artist analytics dashboards.
